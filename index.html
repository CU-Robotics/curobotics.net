            <p class="header">What is CU Robotics?</p>
            <div class="text-body">
                CU Robotics is a new student organization in Fall 2020 that's all about building robots. The primary mission of CU Robotics is to provide a means for students to design, build, program, and compete with industrial-grade robots at the University of Colorado Boulder.

                The main competition we participate in is a collegiate robotics competition called Robomaster, hosted by renowned drone company DJI. Each year, we build eight robots of six unique classes and ultimately compete against 400+ other teams from around the world. From speedy ground units to complex utility bots to autonomous sentries suspended on tracks, we build a wide variety of robots. Throughout the year, students devise a winning strategy, design robots using CAD, manufacture their designs, and finally program and test their creations before the competition.

            <div class="text-body">
                When not building for Robomaster 9 months out of the year, we participate in various design competitions such as the NASA Moon to Mars Ice & Prospecting Challenge and hold regular engineering and business workshops to train our members.

            <p class="header">About Robomaster</p>
            <div class="text-body">
                Robomaster is formatted like a MOBA video game: one team against the other. Six of the eight robots in a fleet are controlled by humans through a camera to provide a first person view, competing tasks to provide buffs to their team while dealing damage to the enemy. The robots fight by firing paintball and golf ball-sized projectiles at pressure sensitive plates on the enemy robots, dealing damage based on the weight and speed of each projectile.

            <div class="text-body">
                The competition also presents difficult programming and AI challenges; A completely autonomous sentry robot is the main line of defense preventing enemy robots from destroying our base. Having a successful sentry means designing efficient and accurate computer vision software that dodges incoming fire and returns fatal blows back at the attacking robots.
